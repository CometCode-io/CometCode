Have you heard of Hyper yet? If not, you're seriously missing out. As with every good tool obsessed developer, Hyper has been a recent obsession of mine. What's not to love? A cross platform highly configurable terminal that is written in Electron.

Looking for the juicy stuff? I've included a ready-to-go hyper config at the bottom of this post :)

Since Hyper is built with Electron JS, the whole thing is super customizable via HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This means developers have written all sorts of plugins, some of my favorites we'll be covering.05

This also means the whole window is easily customizable. Don't like having a tob bar? You can remove it with a css `display: none` property by setting that as css in your ~/.hyper.js file

# Best Hyper Font

[FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is my favorite font for the terminal and IDE's. The ligatures, or icons, are amazing for developers, and it integrates perfectly with my zsh theme, spaceship.

# My Favorite Plugins

- Hyper-spotify - itâ€™s in the name: control your spotify from the comfort of your terminal
- Hyperline - System stats on the bottom of your terminal. A pretty awesome addition.
- Hyper-pane - Paned termianls embedded in one big window. A developers dream when having to manage multiple terminals
- Hyper-links - Easily click and open links from Hyper without having to copy and paste
- Hyper-tabs-enhanced - Additioanl information on each tab, such as directory, running process, etc.
- Hyper-active-tab - Display a fun icon whenever an active process is running in your terminal

You can find a my hyper-config in [this Github Repo](https://github.com/caelinsutch/ubuntu-desktop-setup) along with an awesome setup script that'll be covered in another post.
