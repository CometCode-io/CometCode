Flowcharts are a type of diagram used to represent a workflow or process. There are various types of flowcharts:
- *Document flowcharts*, showing controls over a document flow in a system.
- *Data flowcharts*, showing controls over a data-flow in a system
- *System flowcharts*, showing controls at a physical or resource level
- *Program flowchart*, showing the controls in a program within a system

Flowcharts have boxes of various types, and their order with connecting arrows. They're often used to document or manage a process of program. Flowcharts are also great for planning out complex software architecture. 

# Flowchart Symbols
There are various standard symbols that are used when building flowcharts. 

**Flowline (Arrowhead)**

Show the process's order of operations. These link symbols together. 

**Terminal**

These indicate the beginning or end of a program or subprocess. These usually contain the words "Start" or "End" or another phrase. For example, this may contain the words boot.

**Process**
![Process](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Flowchart_Process.svg/150px-Flowchart_Process.svg.png)

Represent an operation in a program that changes the data in some way. 

**Decision**
![Decision](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Flowchart_Decision.svg/150px-Flowchart_Decision.svg.png)

Shows a conditional operation in a program that changes the path the program will take. This is often a yes/no or true/false test.

**Input/Output**
![Input/Output](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Flowchart_IO.svg/150px-Flowchart_IO.svg.png)

Indicated some sort of input or output data, such as a user entering data or displaying results on a screen.

**Predefined Process**
![Predefined Process](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Flowchart_Predefined_Process.svg/150px-Flowchart_Predefined_Process.svg.png)

Shows a named process that is defined elswhere.

**Datafile/Database**
![Datafile/Database](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Flowchart_database.svg/81px-Flowchart_database.svg.png)

Some sort of external or internal data storage.

**Document(s)**
![Document(s)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Flowchart_Document_multiple.svg/96px-Flowchart_Document_multiple.svg.png)

Single data document represented by a single rectangle, multiple they're stacked (as shown above).

# Example

Colors are used depending on the symbol normally. 

Flowcharts can look really complex, but once you've worked with them for a little bit, it'll all start making sense!
