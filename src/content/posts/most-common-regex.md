# What is Regex?
Regex is short for a "Regular Expression", which is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern for text. Usually, these are used to perform search or replace operations on strings, or for input validation. You can use Regex in practically every language to perform operations on strings.

Regex can be confusing as hell to write, but here are some of the most common Regex expressions for you to use in your software.
