## Who are you?
It's a pleasure to meet you! I'm Caelin, the founder of this website. I'm run a creative firm and currently am the CTO of a Robotics Startup based in Sacramento California.
I've delved into various applications of software development, from low level Arduino and microcontroller firmware to highly abstracted robotics development with the ROS stack.
I've developed this blog as a place to not just share my knowledge, but hopefully coalesce a like-minded community of entrepreneurs and technologists who see the infinite possibilities that await us in the future with technology.

## Why should we want to learn from you?

Well that's a good question, one I have no answer for. I'm making this partially for my own amusement, but also for the sake of creating. Whether or not you actually get anything out of what I post on here is purely up to you.

## What will you be talking about on here

Now this is a fun list. Here's some topics I know that I'll be covering.05

1. Basic Linux
The amount of programmers who can't navigate linux well is quite incredible. I guess I'm biased, coming from a robotics background, but knowing how Linux works is I think essential

2. Robotics
Well I did co-found a robotics startup. We'll be learning about ROS and ROS2 using Python and C++

3. Web Development
My origins are in the wonderful world of web development, so I'm sure we'll be spending a lot of time there

4. App Development
Not native app development, but Flutter and React Native

5. Hardware
I do love my hardware, especially keyboards, mice, and sexy programming stations. I'm sure you'll enjoy them too.

6. Creative Stuff
I was originally in the creative arena, so photography, videogrpahy, but mostly graphic design in relation to UI and UX. This is where I see most programmers fail, making amazing software user friendly and beautiful.05

## This is a sweet website, how did you make it?

Well thank you for the compliment. This is a website built off of GatsbyJS, a static site generator I'm sure we'll be talking about. Fun fact, I learned GatsbyJS while making this website, as well as a lot of React.

## What's your favorite language?

This is a hard one. It's currently a tie between Typescript and Dart. Dart is incredibly fast, and I like the optionally typed syntax and modern operators. Typescript is my roots, so that still takes first place. We'll see as Dart gains more market share in web technologies
